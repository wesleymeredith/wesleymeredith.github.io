I really enjoy listening to music, and alongside that I am also really interested in how platforms like Spotify work. So in this project I created a Spotify 'wrapped' clone that will tell users about what their top artists are over the three time periods available. In doing this I learned about developer APIs, and access control flows like OAuth.

Future plans are to host the program on a website so you can test it out yourself, but for now I will include screenshots of what it looks like. Here are some screenshots:
