- I'm in my final year of a M.S. in Computer Science at NC State University in Raleigh, NC.

- My interests are in machine learning, data science, and software engineering.

- Specifically, I have interests in recommendation systems, like the ones that govern some of the biggest social media applications, GenAI, NLP, human-computer interaction and computer-vision.


My Story
======

My journey began with a Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry at Clemson University. During my time there, I tackled real-world challenges through research, culminating in a peer-reviewed published [paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011082) on building a Markov model to yield valuable insights into a scientific problem. This experience opened my eyes to the potential of computational approaches in driving scientific discovery. Fueled by a passion to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications, I enrolled in the MSCS Ready Program at Clemson to hone my computer science and programming skills.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NC State University, diving deeper into the exciting realms of machine learning, data science, and software engineering. My goal is to leverage cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems and make a tangible impact.

Also currently, I am spending the summer with Michelin in Greenville, SC as a data scientist intern working on LLMs, Retreival Augmented Generation, and forecasting.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->
