This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

An unconventional start...
======
Hello! I'm Wesley Meredith, a passionate professional navigating the realms of biochemistry and computer science. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Biochemistry at Clemson University, where my first research project, creating a Markov model, opened my eyes to the powerful applications of machine learning and coding in the biochemical field. This realization sparked a profound interest in exploring the vast possibilities of applying computational techniques to solve complex biological problems. Transitioning to the MSCS Ready Program, I honed my coding skills, and now, as a Master's candidate at NC State University, I'm delving into the exciting worlds of machine learning and data science. Join me on this interdisciplinary adventure as we discover how the fusion of biology and technology can reshape our understanding of the world. Connect with me on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/wesleymeredith/) or explore my coding endeavors on GitHub (github.com/wesleymeredith). Let's innovate together! ðŸš€ðŸ§¬

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->
