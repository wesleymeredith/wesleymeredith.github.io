- I'm in my first year of a M.S. in Computer Science at NC State University in Raleigh, NC.

- My interests are in machine learning, data science, and software engineering.

- Specifically, I have interests in recommendation systems, like the ones that govern some of the biggest social media applications, human-computer interaction, and computer-vision.


My Story
======

My path towards data-driven solutions began with a Biochemistry B.S. at Clemson University. There, I tackled real-world challenges through research, culminating in a peer-reviewed published [paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011082). Building a Markov model not only yielded valuable insights but also opened my eyes to the power of computational approaches in scientific discovery. This sparked my passion for bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. 

To refine my technical skills, I enrolled in the MSCS Ready Program at Clemson, mastering fundamental programming concepts. Currently, at NC State University, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Science, diving deeper into the exciting realms of machine learning, data science, and software-engineering.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->
