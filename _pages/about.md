I'm in my first year of a M.S. in Computer Science at NC State University in Raleigh, NC.

My interests are in machine learning, data science, and software engineering.

Specifically, I have interests in recommendation systems, like the ones that govern some of the biggest social media applications, human-computer interaction, and computer-vision.


My Story
======

My academic journey fuses technical skills with interdisciplinary interests. As a student earning my Biochemistry Bachelorâ€™s at Clemson University, my first research project building a Markov model opened my eyes. I saw first-hand how computing technologies could advance innovations across disciplines. I realized that leveraging data, modeling, and analysis can illuminate solutions to multifaceted real-world problems.

Eager to expand my skillset, I honed my programming abilities across diverse domains in the MSCS Ready Program. Now pursuing a Masterâ€™s at NC State University, Iâ€™m diving deeper into areas like machine learning and data science, while connecting techniques to high-level applications.

Get in touch and let's have a chat about how we can work together. Connect with me on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/wesleymeredith/) or explore my coding endeavors on GitHub (github.com/wesleymeredith) ðŸš€ðŸ§¬

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->
